          question: 'Do I need a visa to travel to India?',

        {
          question: 'What time do I need to arrive at the event?',
          answer: 'Our first event (Haldi / Mehendi) kicks off at 12.00pm. Room check-ins are not guaranteed to be available until 2pm. If your room is not available upon arrival, the hotel staff will hold your bags and take them to your rooms when they are ready to allow for you to immerse yourself in the festivities and lunch. As such, we recommend that you are dressed and ready to go prior to arrival at the property. We will of course have areas to freshen up as needed.'
